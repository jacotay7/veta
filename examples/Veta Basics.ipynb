    "Veta is comprised of three main components (called classes in computer science): the item, respondent, and survey. Each of these classes is designed around how an LEAS survey would typically be conducted with the idea being that the programmer should be able to simply and naturally score LEAS data. Additionally, veta implements a number of scoring methodologies that can be applied across entire surveys or just to responses of responents aswell as several basic analysis functions which can be applied to visualize survey data."
